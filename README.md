# twitter-sentiment-analysis
A python script made by utilizing the Tweepy API by twitter. This is a project I made for an internship in the summer of 2021 to guage the sentiment of words being used in the title for posts, helping choose better words for headings of posts on the web. The results are displayed in numerical format as well as through a color-coded pie-chart for all sentiments' around the keyowrd. The sentiments defined are as follows:

+ Neutral
+ Weakly Positive
+ Moderately Positive
+ Strongly Positive
+ Weakly Negative
+ Moderately Negative
+ Strongly Negative
